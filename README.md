## Bangalore House Price Prediction

This project predicts real estate prices (houses, apartments, and plots) across **Bangalore**, using data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanbera19/bengaluru-house-price-dataset.

---

## Project Overview

* Trained a **Model** to estimate property prices based on features like total area, number of bedrooms, and location.
* Preprocessed for inconsistent or noisy data through various data pipelines
* Compared the performance with other  **Statistical models**.
* Used **Cross-Validation** and **ShuffleSplit** to evaluate model consistency.
* Exports trained model as `FinalModel.pickle` for reuse

---

## Tech Stack

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas** for data manipulation
* **NumPy** for numerical operations
* **Matplotlib** for visualization
* **Scikit-learn** for model training

---

## Usage

To use the model in your project:

```python
import pickle

with open('FinalModel.pickle', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Example input
features = ['Indira Nagar', 1102, 3,'Carpet Area']   //['location',total_sqft, bhk, 'Build Type']
predicted_price = model.predict([features])
print(predicted_price)
```

## Contact

If you have an **updated dataset**, feel free to reach out!

I’m happy to **retrain** the model and improve its performance.

If you’d like to collaborate or to suggest improvements, feel free to ping me — I’m always open to learning and feedback.
